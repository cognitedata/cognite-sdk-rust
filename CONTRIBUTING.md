# Contributing

This project adheres to [Contributor Covenant v2.0](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/0/code_of_conduct/) as a code of conduct.

## Setup

You will need to install [cargo](https://crates.io/), the latest stable rust version using [rustup](https://rustup.rs/), and a version of protobuf-compiler, on debian based systems that can be installed using `sudo apt-get install protobuf-compiler`.

`cargo build` builds a development version of the SDK.

Before making a pull request, you should fix any warnings or errors generated by `cargo build`, run `cargo fmt` to format the code, and fix any warnings generated by `cargo clippy`. These will all cause CI builds to fail.

## Testing

The tests are integration tests, and require a CDF project to run. Export the environment variables `COGNITE_PROJECT`, `COGNITE_BASE_URL`, `COGNITE_CLIENT_ID`, `COGNITE_CLIENT_SECRET`, `COGNITE_TOKEN_URL`, and `COGNITE_SCOPES`, and run `cargo test` to run all the tests. Tests also run as part of CI.
